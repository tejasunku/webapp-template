# Formal Model Concerns
formal_model_concerns:
  # These sections identify which formal models might be needed

  structural_concerns:
    - "Client isolation properties need Alloy analysis"
    - "Process/thread relationship modeling required"

    - "Concurrent client access patterns may need TLA+ analysis"
    - "Race conditions in client creation/reuse"
