# Client Factory Pattern Validation - Enhanced Gherkin Specifications
# Incorporates formal model findings from Alloy and TLA+ analysis
# Milestone v0.0.0 - Shared Adapter Protocol Validation

@feature: Client Factory Pattern Validation
  @id: F-001
  To ensure mathematically-proven thread-safe and process-scoped client management
  As a developer implementing the Teja Pattern with formal verification
  I want a client factory that guarantees client isolation and resource safety
  Based on Alloy structural analysis and TLA+ temporal verification

  Background:
    Given the Shared Adapter Protocol is implemented in "shared/utils/clientFactory"
    And formal model analysis confirms client isolation is required (Alloy structural concern)
    And concurrent access patterns require temporal verification (TLA+ concern)
    And the application may run in multi-process or multi-threaded environments
    And client factory follows strict scoping rules with mathematical guarantees

  # Process-Scoped Client Isolation (Alloy PROP-01)

  @scenario: SC-01
  Scenario: Process-scoped client uniqueness guarantee
    Given a client factory for Database clients is created
    When the factory is called in process with ID 123 and thread ID 0
    Then it should initialize exactly one Database client instance
    When the factory is called again in process 123 and thread ID 0
    Then it should return the same Database client instance
    When the factory is called in process with ID 124 and thread ID 0
    Then it should initialize a different Database client instance
    And the two clients should have no shared state or connections
    And each process should have exactly one Database client per thread

  @scenario: SC-02
  Scenario: Process isolation invariant under concurrent access
    Given a client factory for Cache clients is created
    When process 123 and process 124 simultaneously request Cache clients
    Then each process should receive its own isolated Cache client
    And no Cache client should be shared across processes
    And concurrent operations should not violate process boundaries
    And each process should maintain independent client state

  # Thread Isolation Within Same Process (Alloy PROP-02)

  @scenario: SC-03
  Scenario: Thread isolation within same process
    Given a client factory for Queue clients is created in process 123
    When the factory is called in thread ID 0 of process 123
    Then it should initialize exactly one Queue client instance
    When the factory is called in thread ID 1 of the same process 123
    Then it should initialize a different Queue client instance
    And the two Queue clients should be completely isolated
    And thread ID changes should always trigger client reinitialization

  @scenario: SC-04
  Scenario: Thread isolation under high concurrency
    Given a client factory for ExternalAPI clients is created
    When 10 different threads in the same process request ExternalAPI clients
    Then each thread should receive its own isolated ExternalAPI client
    And no two threads should share the same client instance
    And concurrent client creation should not cause race conditions
    And all threads should maintain independent client lifecycles

  # Factory Type Consistency (Alloy PROP-03)

  @scenario: SC-05
  Scenario: Factory manages only declared client types
    Given a client factory is configured for Database, Cache, and Queue clients
    When a Database client is requested
    Then it should return a properly typed Database client
    When a Cache client is requested
    Then it should return a properly typed Cache client
    When a Queue client is requested
    Then it should return a properly typed Queue client
    And the factory should never create undefined client types
    And all returned clients should match their declared types exactly

  @scenario: SC-06
  Scenario: Factory type consistency under validation
    Given a client factory with type validation enabled
    When client type validation is performed
    Then all factory clients should be of valid types (Database, Cache, Queue, ExternalAPI)
    And no invalid client types should exist in the factory
    And type consistency should be maintained across all operations
    And factory should enforce type safety at runtime

  # Client Initialization Idempotency (Alloy PROP-04)

  @scenario: SC-07
  Scenario: Client initialization idempotency guarantee
    Given a client factory for Database clients is created
    When the factory is called 10 times with the same process ID and thread ID
    Then it should initialize exactly one Database client instance
    And all 10 calls should return the same client reference
    And initialization should happen only once per process/thread combination
    And subsequent calls should return cached instances instantly

  @scenario: SC-08
  Scenario: Client reuse follows strict scoping rules
    Given a client factory maintains internal client cache
    When the same process/thread combination requests the same client type
    Then the cached client should be returned without reinitialization
    When process ID or thread ID changes
    Then a new client should be created for the new scope
    And old clients should remain isolated in their original scopes

  # Formal Model Edge Cases (Alloy Counterexamples)

  @scenario: SC-09
  Scenario: Minimal system configuration (Edge Case)
    Given a system with exactly 1 process and 1 thread
    When a client factory is created
    Then it should handle the minimal configuration correctly
    And client creation should succeed with the smallest possible scope
    And no scalability issues should occur in minimal environments

  @scenario: SC-10
  Scenario: Maximum complexity handling (Edge Case)
    Given a system with 5 processes, 15 threads, and 30 potential clients
    When client factory operations are performed at maximum scale
    Then all client isolation invariants should be maintained
    And performance should remain acceptable under high load
    And no memory leaks or resource exhaustion should occur
    And all formal properties should hold even at maximum complexity

  @scenario: SC-11
  Scenario: Process and thread relationship validation
    Given the formal model constraint that threads belong to processes
    When client factory creates clients
    Then all clients should properly track their parent process
    And all clients should properly track their parent thread
    And thread-process relationships should never be violated
    And client isolation should respect the process hierarchy

  # TLA+ Temporal Properties

  @scenario: SC-12
  Scenario: Type safety under temporal evolution (TLA+ TypeSafety)
    Given a client factory operating over time
    When clients are created and reused across multiple operations
    Then no two clients of the same type should exist in different processes/threads
    And type safety invariants should hold forever (â–¡TypeSafety)
    And temporal evolution should never violate isolation properties
    And all state transitions should preserve type correctness

  @scenario: SC-13
  Scenario: Client liveness guarantees (TLA+ ClientLiveness)
    Given a client factory with active processes and threads
    When a client request is made for a valid process/thread combination
    Then the request should eventually be satisfied (<>ClientExists)
    And client creation should not deadlock or livelock
    And every valid request should eventually receive a client instance
    And temporal liveness should be guaranteed under normal operation

  @scenario: SC-14
  Scenario: State transition correctness
    Given client factory state transitions follow TLA+ specification
    When processes are created, destroyed, or modified
    Then all state transitions should preserve system invariants
    And no invalid states should be reachable
    And client creation/reuse should follow the formal Next state relation
    And all temporal properties should hold during state changes

  # Concurrent Access Patterns

  @scenario: SC-15
  Scenario: Concurrent client creation without race conditions
    Given multiple threads simultaneously request different client types
    When all threads execute client factory calls concurrently
    Then each thread should receive its correct client type
    And no race conditions should occur during client creation
    And all isolation invariants should be preserved under concurrency
    And performance should remain acceptable with concurrent access

  @scenario: SC-16
  Scenario: Client factory thread safety under stress
    Given 100 concurrent operations across multiple processes and threads
    When the client factory is stressed with high concurrency
    Then all operations should complete successfully
    And no client isolation violations should occur
    And no corruption of internal factory state should happen
    And thread safety should be mathematically guaranteed

  # Resource Lifecycle Management

  @scenario: SC-17
  Scenario: Automatic resource cleanup on process termination
    Given a process with active client instances
    When the process terminates gracefully
    Then all clients belonging to that process should be cleaned up
    And no resource leaks should occur from terminated processes
    And cleanup should happen automatically without manual intervention

  @scenario: SC-18
  Scenario: Resource cleanup on thread termination
    Given a thread with active client instances
    When the thread terminates or changes
    Then clients belonging to that thread should be marked for cleanup
    And new thread ID should trigger client reinitialization
    And old thread clients should not interfere with new thread clients

  # Error Handling and Recovery

  @scenario: SC-19
  Scenario: Graceful handling of client initialization failures
    Given a client factory with a failing client type
    When client initialization fails for a specific process/thread
    Then the error should be propagated to the caller
    And subsequent requests should retry initialization
    And successful retries should restore normal operation
    And failed clients should not corrupt the factory state

  @scenario: SC-20
  Scenario: System recovery after transient failures
    Given a client factory experiencing temporary network failures
    When client initialization fails due to transient issues
    Then the factory should attempt recovery on subsequent requests
    And successful recovery should restore all client functionality
    And recovery should not violate any isolation invariants

  # Configuration and Validation

  @scenario: SC-21
  Scenario: Factory configuration validation
    Given a client factory with various configuration options
    When factory configuration is validated
    Then all configuration parameters should be validated
    And invalid configurations should be rejected immediately
    And configuration changes should not affect existing clients
    And validation should preserve all formal invariants

  @scenario: SC-22
  Scenario: Runtime validation of client factory invariants
    Given a running client factory with active clients
    When runtime invariant validation is performed
    Then all Alloy model invariants should hold in production
    And all TLA+ temporal properties should be preserved
    And any invariant violations should trigger immediate alerts
    And validation should not impact normal operation performance

  # Performance and Scalability

  @scenario: SC-23
  Scenario: Client creation performance under load
    Given a client factory under high load
    When measuring client creation and reuse performance
    Then client creation should complete within acceptable time bounds
    And client reuse should be significantly faster than creation
    And performance should not degrade with increasing scale
    And all performance guarantees should hold under concurrent access

  @scenario: SC-24
  Scenario: Memory usage optimization
    Given a client factory managing multiple client types
    When memory usage is monitored over time
    Then memory usage should remain within acceptable bounds
    And unused clients should be eligible for garbage collection
    And no memory leaks should occur from client caching
    And memory optimization should not break isolation guarantees

  # Integration with Teja Pattern Workflow

  @scenario: SC-25
  Scenario: Formal model decision validation in practice
    Given the formal model decision flow from the specification
    When implementing the client factory pattern
    Then the decision to use Alloy analysis should be validated
    And the decision to use TLA+ analysis should be validated
    And the simplified workflow should avoid unnecessary formal steps
    And formal model usage should match the documented criteria exactly

  @scenario: SC-26
  Scenario: Milestone requirements traceability
    Given milestone v0.0.0 requirements for client factory validation
    When all Gherkin scenarios are mapped to milestone requirements
    Then every milestone requirement should have corresponding test scenarios
    And every scenario should be traceable to formal model findings
    And the complete specification should guarantee successful implementation
    And traceability should be maintained through the entire development workflow

  Examples of formal model validation in practice:

  Scenario: Alloy model counterexample validation
    Given the Alloy model identified potential isolation violations
    When those edge cases are tested in the implementation
    Then the implementation should handle all identified edge cases correctly
    And no Alloy counterexamples should exist in the actual system
    And all structural invariants should hold in production

  Scenario: TLA+ temporal property verification
    Given the TLA+ model proved liveness and safety properties
    When the system runs under various operational conditions
    Then all temporal properties should hold in practice
    And no deadlocks or race conditions should occur
    And system behavior should match the formal specification exactly
