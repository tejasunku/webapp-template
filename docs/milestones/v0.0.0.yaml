# Core Feature Stories
feature_stories:
  - title: "Process-Scoped Client Isolation"
    description: "Each process should have its own isolated client instances"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Different processes get different client instances
      - Client reinitialization occurs on process ID change
      - No client sharing across process boundaries
      - Thread ID changes trigger client reinitialization

  - title: "Thread-Safe Client Management"
    description: "Client factory must handle multi-threaded environments safely"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Each thread gets appropriate client scoping
      - No race conditions in client creation/reuse
      - Thread ID changes trigger client reinitialization
      - Client lifecycle is properly managed

  - title: "Formal Model Decision Validation"
    description: "Validate when formal models are needed vs when to skip them"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Schema concerns correctly trigger Alloy analysis
      - State machine concerns correctly trigger TLA+ analysis
      - Simple behaviors proceed directly to Gherkin
      - Decision flow works as documented
