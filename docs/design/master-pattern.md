# üåí The Teja Pattern ‚Äî v1.0

*A formal, idempotent, milestone-driven development loop for composable systems*

---

## 1 ¬∑ Core Philosophy

Every piece of software has two truths:

* the **conceptual truth** (intent, models, behaviors), and
* the **executable truth** (code, data, runtime).

The Teja Pattern binds them through explicit, testable artifacts.
Each artifact exists in one layer of the loop and must have a single responsibility.
No knowledge is implicit, no test is purposeless, and no code exists without provenance.

## 2 ¬∑ The Development Loop

```
Intent
 ‚Üì
Milestone (Business Requirements)
 ‚Üì
Clarify existing Resources
 ‚Üì
Division of Responsibility (update Milestone with specifications learned here)
 ‚Ü∫ (Loop back if design changes needed)
 ‚Üì
[Formal Models Decision - See /docs/design/formal-model-flow.md]
 ‚Üì
Behavior (Gherkin) (Readable engineer implementation guide. Should always match milestones, but be less intent focused and cohesive. More comprehensive)
 ‚Ü∫ (Update Milestone if behavior reveals new requirements)
 ‚Üì
Schemas
 ‚Üì
Tests
 ‚Üì
Implementation (Domain / SDK / App / Tests)
 ‚Üì
Versioning & Governance
 ‚Ü∫ (Loop back to refine any stage based on implementation experience)
```

### Key Feedback Loops

1. **Milestone ‚Üî Division of Responsibility**: Specifications learned during responsibility division update milestone requirements
2. **Formal Models ‚Üí Milestone**: Edge cases and constraints discovered update milestone specifications
3. **Gherkin ‚Üí Milestone**: Behavior specifications may reveal missing requirements
4. **Implementation ‚Üí Any Stage**: Implementation experience may require refining any previous stage

**Formal Models Usage**: See `/docs/design/formal-model-flow.md` for detailed decision criteria on when to use Alloy and/or TLA+ models.

Each stage produces structured outputs that the next consumes.
Iteration happens through **milestones** ‚Äî discrete, versioned snapshots of truth.

## 2.1 ¬∑ Formal Model Integration

### Decision-Driven Formal Verification

Formal models are **conditional tools** used only when specific concerns exist:

**Use Alloy for:**
- Schema/interface/data stability problems
- Data consistency and safety concerns
- Complex structural relationships
- Resource sharing and isolation validation

**Use TLA+ for:**
- State machines with non-native transitions (e.g., custom router edge cases)
- Performance guarantees that must be proven
- Race conditions and concurrency concerns
- Complex temporal behavior that isn't natively supported

**Simple behavior goes directly to Gherkin** - native browser events, standard CRUD operations, well-understood patterns.

### Formal Model ‚Üí Milestone Integration

When formal models are used:
1. **Analyze the concern** using appropriate formal method
2. **Document findings** including edge cases and constraints
3. **Update Milestone** with discovered requirements
4. **Assess acceptability** - are the constraints acceptable or is design refinement needed?
5. **Proceed to Gherkin** with updated understanding

**TLA+ Requirement**: All TLA+ models must be backed by Alloy types, even if the Alloy model is mostly boilerplate for type definitions.

### When Formal Models Are Not Used

Most features proceed directly from **Division of Responsibility ‚Üí Gherkin** when:
- No data safety concerns exist
- Behavior is simple and well-understood
- No performance guarantees are required
- No race conditions or complex state management

All applications (like `elysiajs`) follow the same internal structure with `/app`, `/domain`, `/sdk`, and `/tests` buckets.

---

## 5 ¬∑ Adapter & SDK Pattern

Adapters represent external resources.
They must follow the **Shared Adapter Protocol (SAP):**

```ts
// @shared/sdk/clientFactory.ts
export function makeScopedClient<T>(init: () => T): () => T {
  let pid = -1, tid = -1;
  let client: T | null = null;
  return () => {
    const newPid = process.pid;
    const newTid = (require("worker_threads") as any)?.threadId ?? 0;
    if (!client || newPid !== pid || newTid !== tid) {
      pid = newPid; tid = newTid;
      client = init();
    }
    return client;
  };
}
```

Each adapter uses this factory to guarantee:

* one client per process/thread,
* automatic re-init on fork/thread change,
* no top-level side effects,
* full idempotency.

**Adapters never export client instances.**
They export *pure async functions* that wrap SDK calls.

## 6 ¬∑ Testing Philosophy

### 6.1 Global vs Local

| Layer         | Purpose                                                                             | Typical Tests                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Global**    | Integration + behavioral coverage for all features (Gherkin ‚Üí use-case ‚Üí adapters). | Feature specs                       |
| **Domain**    | Pure logic / invariant enforcement.                                                 | Invariant or regression tests       |
| **SDK**       | Non-trivial wrapping logic around SDKs (e.g., retries, normalization).              | Mocked retry or normalization tests |
| **App**       | Branching orchestration.                                                            | Edge-condition tests                |
| **Shared**    | Schema round-trip validation.                                                       | Serialization tests                 |

### 6.2 Gherkin Documentation Requirements

**All Gherkin features must include labels for traceability:**

```gherkin
@feature: Feature Name
  @id: F-XXX
  Feature description...

  @scenario: SC-XXX
  Scenario: Scenario description
    Given ...
    When ...
    Then ...
```

**Required Labels:**
- `@feature: Feature Name` - Feature identification
- `@id: F-XXX` - Unique feature identifier
- `@scenario: SC-XXX` - Unique scenario identifier for test mapping

**Test Mapping:**
- Tests must reference Gherkin scenario IDs in their descriptions
- Each test should map 1:1 to a Gherkin scenario
- Test files must include `@scenario: SC-XXX` labels in test descriptions

> **If behavior is tested globally, you do not need a local SDK test.**
> Local tests only exist for nontrivial logic that can't be observed through end-to-end integration.

### 6.2 "Direct I/O" Rule

If a function deterministically maps input ‚Üí output and has no internal state:

* verify via integration tests,
* rely on TypeScript + schemas for safety,
* no dedicated test required.

### 6.3 Regression Scope

When a bug appears:

1. Add a test where the bug lived (domain, sdk, app).
2. Patch the code.
3. Increment **patch version** for that module.
4. Keep global tests unchanged unless behavior changed.

## 7 ¬∑ Versioning Semantics

| Type      | Trigger                               | Effect                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Patch** | Bug fix or stability improvement.     | Add regression tests.                     |
| **Minor** | New feature or non-breaking behavior. | Add new feature tests.                    |
| **Major** | Backward-incompatible change.         | Update relevant Gherkin + schema + tests. |

Each service or library versions **independently**, while the overall monorepo milestone tracks global coherence.

---

## 8 ¬∑ Governance and CI

### Manifest Rules (`/ai/manifest.yaml`)

```yaml
sdk_policy:
  - "All adapters must use makeScopedClient()."
  - "No SDK initialized at import time."
  - "Clients reinitialize when PID/thread changes."

test_policy:
  - "Global tests for each Gherkin feature."
  - "Domain tests only for invariants."
  - "SDK tests only for nontrivial transformations or retry logic."
  - "Regression tests live beside their origin module."

doc_policy:
  - "Single canonical /docs/design/master-pattern.md per monorepo."
  - "Local READMEs reference the canonical design doc."

version_policy:
  - "Patch = bug fix, Minor = new feature, Major = breaking change."
```

### CI Loop

1. Type + lint
2. Alloy / TLA‚Å∫ verification
3. Schema generation
4. Test suite
5. Manifest compliance
6. PR summarization + milestone update

---

## 9 ¬∑ Milestone Workflow

### 9.1 Milestone Philosophy

**Small, frequent, implementable milestones** are the core of the Teja Pattern. Each milestone should be achievable within 1-2 days and provide immediate value.

### 9.2 Milestone Characteristics

**v0.0.0 - The "Hello World" Milestone**
- Duration: ~1 day
- Goal: Validate basic project setup and workflow
- Example: Simple text input with submit button that saves to backend
- Purpose: Prove the development loop works end-to-end

**Incremental Milestones**
- Duration: 1-2 days each
- Goal: Add specific, testable functionality
- Value: Each milestone delivers working features
- Feedback: Implementation experience refines future milestones

### 9.3 Milestone Requirements

**Every milestone must:**
1. **Be Implementable** - Can be completed within 1-2 days
2. **Provide Value** - Delivers working, demonstrable functionality
3. **Be Testable** - Has comprehensive test coverage
4. **Be Documented** - Updated architecture and intent as needed
5. **Be Deployable** - Can be deployed and used immediately

### 9.4 Milestone Workflow

1. **Define Milestone** - Create specific, achievable scope
2. **Implement** - Build functionality using Teja Pattern
3. **Test** - Ensure comprehensive coverage
4. **Validate** - Confirm milestone meets requirements
5. **Deploy** - Release working milestone
6. **Refine** - Update intent and future milestones based on implementation experience

### 9.5 Milestone Artifacts

Each milestone generates:
- Working code implementation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Updated documentation
- Deployment artifacts
- Lessons learned for next milestone

### 9.6 Milestone Files

- `/docs/milestones/vX.Y.Z.yaml` - Milestone definition and requirements
- Implementation code in appropriate service directories
- Test coverage for all new functionality
- Updated architecture documentation

## 10 ¬∑ Scaling & Exports

When extracting a service or library:

1. Copy `/shared/sdk/` and `/docs/design/master-pattern.md`.
2. Include only relevant `/domain`, `/app`.
3. Retain tests and schemas.
4. Create new `/ai/manifest.yaml` for version tracking.

This keeps exported modules autonomous yet philosophically identical.

---

## 11 ¬∑ Principles Summary

1. **Every artifact serves a neighbor.**
   Intent feeds models; models feed behaviors; behaviors feed tests; tests feed code.
2. **Never test what you don't own.**
   SDKs are assumed correct; wrappers are not.
3. **One client per process.**
   No shared global state.
4. **Behavior is contract; schema is law.**
5. **Documentation is centralized; implementation is local.**
6. **Milestones freeze truth; versions describe motion.**

| **Tests**      | Global > Local > Regression                                  |
| **Docs**       | One canonical design doc per monorepo                        |
| **Versioning** | Patch = fix, Minor = feature, Major = break                  |
| **Governance** | Manifest defines all policies                                |
| **Goal**       | Iterative, provable, idempotent systems                      |

## 13 ¬∑ Final Statement

> **The Teja Pattern** is a closed, living system of design.
> Every artifact mirrors another: behavior implies structure, structure implies law, law implies code.
>
> It replaces heroics with harmony ‚Äî a development philosophy where correctness emerges from care and iteration, not control.
>
> **Implementation is not improvisation.** It is the final movement of a verified composition.
