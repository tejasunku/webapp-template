# Intent - Web App Monorepo Template

## Purpose

To provide a formal, systematic foundation for building composable web applications using the Teja Pattern - a milestone-driven development methodology that binds conceptual truth to executable truth through explicit, testable artifacts.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Establish a closed development loop** where every artifact serves its neighbor through the chain: intent ’ resources ’ responsibility ’ models ’ behavior ’ schemas ’ tests ’ implementation ’ governance

2. **Eliminate implicit knowledge** by ensuring every piece of code has provenance through explicit documentation, testable behavior, and verifiable architecture

3. **Enable systematic composition** where applications can be built, scaled, and extracted as autonomous modules while maintaining philosophical consistency

4. **Provide provable correctness** through formal models (Alloy/TLAz), behavioral specifications (Gherkin), and comprehensive testing strategies

### Secondary Goals

1. **Reduce cognitive overhead** by establishing clear boundaries between domain logic, external adapters, application orchestration, and testing

2. **Enable parallel development** through well-defined interfaces and contracts that allow teams to work independently

3. **Facilitate continuous delivery** through automated governance, milestone tracking, and versioned dependencies

4. **Support long-term maintainability** through centralized documentation, local implementation, and systematic regression testing

## Constraints

1. **No implicit side effects** - All external dependencies must be explicitly declared and managed through the Shared Adapter Protocol

2. **Single source of truth** - One canonical design document per monorepo, with all local documentation referencing it

3. **Testable artifacts only** - Every component must have corresponding tests that verify its intended behavior

4. **Process isolation** - All adapters must maintain one client per process/thread with automatic re-initialization

## Success Criteria

1. **Developer onboarding** - New developers can understand the entire system architecture within 30 minutes

2. **Feature velocity** - New features can be implemented end-to-end (intent ’ tests ’ implementation) within a single development cycle

3. **System reliability** - All deployed services have >99.9% uptime with comprehensive monitoring and automated rollback capabilities

4. **Code quality** - All codebases maintain >90% test coverage with zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Anti-Goals

1. **Over-engineering** - Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers that don't provide clear value

2. **Technology lock-in** - The pattern should be adaptable to different frameworks and platforms while maintaining core principles

3. **Rapid prototyping at the expense of structure** - While speed is important, it should not compromise the systematic approach

4. **Hero-driven development** - The system should work through systematic processes, not individual exceptional efforts

## Scope

### In Scope

- Web application development with frontend/backend separation
- External service integration (databases, caches, queues, storage)
- Real-time features and state management
- API design and documentation
- Testing strategies and automation
- Deployment and monitoring
- Multi-tenant architectures

### Out of Scope

- Mobile application development (though patterns can be adapted)
- Machine learning model training and deployment
- DevOps infrastructure management
- Desktop application development
- Embedded systems development

## Evolution

This monorepo template is designed to evolve through discrete milestones. Each milestone represents a verified, stable state that can be built upon with confidence. The pattern itself is versioned, allowing for systematic improvement while maintaining backward compatibility where possible.
