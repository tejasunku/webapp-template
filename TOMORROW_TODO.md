# Tomorrow's Todo List - Environment Setup and Testing

## [Primary Goal]
Set up complete development environment and test the AI agent toolchain using the client factory and ElysiaJS server as examples.

## [Priority 1: Environment Setup]

### Docker & Containerization
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for ElysiaJS backend service
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for database service (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for Redis service
- [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- [ ] Test docker-compose startup and connectivity
- [ ] Ensure health checks work in containerized environment

### Cross-App Configuration Sharing
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- [ ] Set up configuration sharing mechanism between apps
- [ ] Create configuration validation with Valibot schemas
- [ ] Test environment variable loading in each service
- [ ] Document configuration requirements and setup

### Build Processes
- [ ] Add `make build` command for each app (`apps/backend/elysiajs/package.json`)
- [ ] Set up TypeScript compilation for each service
- [ ] Create production build configurations
- [ ] Test build process for ElysiaJS app
- [ ] Ensure build artifacts are properly organized

## [Priority 2: Testing Infrastructure]

### Test the AI Agent Toolchain
- [ ] **Test Client Factory**: Run existing tests and verify they pass
  ```bash
  make test
  cd shared/utils && bun test
  ```

- [ ] **Test ElysiaJS Server**: Start server and verify health endpoints
  ```bash
  cd apps/backend/elysiajs && bun run dev
  curl http://localhost:3000/health
  ```

- [ ] **Test AI Agent Workflow**:
  ```bash
  # Note: These will fail initially due to missing formal models
  # But test the agent execution and file generation
  make agent-behavior
  make agent-schemas
  make agent-test
  ```

### Test Database Integration
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL in docker-compose
- [ ] Test database connectivity from ElysiaJS app
- [ ] Verify Drizzle ORM setup and migrations
- [ ] Create basic CRUD endpoints to test database integration
- [ ] Run integration tests for database operations

### Test Service Communication
- [ ] Test Redis connectivity for caching
- [ ] Test client factory with database service
- [ ] Test client factory with cache service
- [ ] Verify process/thread isolation works correctly
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery

## [Priority 3: Validation and Quality Assurance]

### Validate Complete Workflow
- [ ] **Makefile Commands**: Test all new Make commands
  ```bash
  make help                    # Verify all commands are documented
  make gherkin-validate        # Test Gherkin validation
  make schema-validate         # Test schema validation
  make test-interface         # Test interface tests
  make validate-testing        # Test complete validation
  ```

- [ ] **Agent File Validation**: Verify all agent files are properly created
  ```bash
  ls -la ai/agents/
  # Should see: behavior-agent.md, schema-agent.md, testing-agent.md, etc.
  ```

- [ ] **Project Structure Validation**: Ensure all directories are created
  ```bash
  find . -type d -name "domain" -o -name "interface" -o -name "schemas"
  ```

### Code Quality and Documentation
- [ ] Run linting and type checking across all packages
  ```bash
  make lint
  make typecheck
  ```

- [ ] Verify README.md is up-to-date with all changes
- [ ] Check that all new commands are documented in Makefile help
- [ ] Validate that package.json files have proper scripts

## [Priority 4: Integration Testing]

### End-to-End Workflow Test
- [ ] **Complete Milestone v0.0.0 Validation**:
  1. Start all services with docker-compose
  2. Run all tests and verify they pass
  3. Test health endpoints across all services
  4. Verify client factory works in containerized environment
  5. Test error handling and recovery scenarios

### Performance and Reliability
- [ ] Test client factory performance under load
- [ ] Verify database connection pooling works correctly
- [ ] Test Redis caching functionality
- [ ] Validate error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Test service restart and recovery

## [Priority 5: Documentation and Cleanup]

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md with any additional setup requirements
- [ ] Document docker-compose usage and environment setup
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document testing strategy and how to run tests
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with any additional workflow guidance

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any temporary files or debug code
- [ ] Ensure all file permissions are correct
- [ ] Verify .gitignore is comprehensive
- [ ] Clean up any unused dependencies
- [ ] Ensure consistent code formatting

## [Validation Criteria for Success]

### Must-Have Success Criteria
- [ ] All services start successfully with docker-compose
- [ ] Client factory tests pass in containerized environment
- [ ] ElysiaJS health endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity and basic CRUD operations work
- [ ] Redis caching functionality works
- [ ] All Make commands execute without errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass

### Nice-to-Have Success Criteria
- [ ] AI agent toolchain generates files (even if tests fail initially)
- [ ] Integration tests between services work
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Error handling and recovery scenarios work correctly

## [Tools and Commands to Use]

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild specific service
docker-compose up --build elysiajs
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
make test-interface
make test-domain

# Validate artifacts
make validate-artifacts
make validate-testing
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development
make dev

# Build all services
make build

# Clean and rebuild
make clean-build
```

## [Notes for Tomorrow]

1. **Focus on Environment**: Get the basic development environment working first before testing advanced features
2. **Use Client Factory as Test Case**: It's the most complete implementation we have
3. **Test Incrementally**: Don't try to test everything at once - validate each component individually
4. **Document Issues**: Keep track of any problems encountered for future reference
5. **Backup Progress**: Commit working states frequently to avoid losing progress

## [Expected Outcome]

By end of tomorrow, we should have:
- Working development environment with Docker
- All services running and communicating
- Client factory and ElysiaJS server thoroughly tested
- Complete testing infrastructure validated
- Documentation updated with setup instructions
- Ready for next milestone development (v0.0.1 - Basic Data Flow)

**Remember**: This is about getting the foundation solid so we can build on it confidently in future milestones!
