   - Maintain traceability labels (@feature, @id, @scenario)

3. **Business Logic Mapping**
   - Map formal properties to business requirements
   - Convert temporal properties to user workflows
   - Translate system invariants to acceptance criteria
   - Ensure business value orientation

4. **Test Scenario Design**

## Translation Patterns

### Alloy to Gherkin Translation

**Alloy Assertion:**
```alloy
assert ProcessScopedClients {
    all p: Process, t: Thread |
        lone c: Client | c.process = p and c.thread = t
}
```

**Gherkin Scenario:**
```gherkin
@scenario: SC-012
Scenario: Process-scoped client isolation
  Given a client factory is configured for database connections
  When process A requests a database client
  Then process A receives a unique client instance
  When process B requests a database client
  Then process B receives a different client instance
  And the two clients are independent
```

### TLA+ to Gherkin Translation

**TLA+ Temporal Property:**
```tla
ClientLiveness ==
    \A pid \in processes, tid \in Nat, ctype \in ClientTypes :
        /\ <<pid, tid>> \in threads
        => <>\/ClientExists(pid, tid, ctype)
```

**Gherkin Scenario:**
```gherkin
@scenario: SC-013
Scenario: Client request liveness
  Given a client factory is available
  When a process requests a client of any type
  Then the client is eventually provided
  And the request does not timeout
  And the client is properly initialized
```

## Example Complete Feature

### Database Service Interface Feature

```gherkin
@feature: Database Service Interface
  @id: F-002
  @traceability: alloy-data-flow tla-client-factory-dynamics intent-data-persistence
  To ensure reliable and consistent data persistence
  As a developer using Teja Pattern
  I want a robust database service interface with proper connection management
  So that my application can safely store and retrieve data

  Background:
    Given the database service uses Supabase client adapter
    And the adapter implements Shared Adapter Protocol (SAP)
    And all database operations are async and return Promises
    And connections are managed with makeScopedClient()
    And the service may run in multi-process environments

  @scenario: SC-020
  Scenario: Database client isolation across processes
    Given a database client factory is configured
    When process with ID 101 requests a database client
    Then it receives a client instance connected to process 101
    When process with ID 102 requests a database client
    Then it receives a different client instance connected to process 102
    And the two clients can operate independently
    And changes through one client are visible to the other

  @scenario: SC-021
  Scenario: Query execution with proper error handling
    Given a database client is properly initialized
    When a valid SELECT query is executed
    Then the query returns matching records as Promises
    When an invalid SQL query is executed
    Then the operation rejects with a descriptive error
    And the database connection remains stable
    And subsequent operations can succeed

  @scenario: SC-022
  Scenario: Transaction management and rollback
    Given a database transaction is started
    When multiple operations are executed within the transaction
    Then all operations succeed or fail together
    When an error occurs during transaction execution
    Then the transaction is automatically rolled back
    And the database state is unchanged from before transaction

  @scenario: SC-023
  Scenario: Connection recovery after failure
    Given a database client loses connection to the server
    When the next operation is attempted
    Then the client attempts to reconnection automatically
    And the operation either succeeds or fails with clear error
    And the client state remains consistent
    When the server becomes available again
    Then subsequent operations can succeed normally

  @scenario: SC-024
  Scenario: Schema validation and type safety
    Given a database table has defined schema constraints
    When data is inserted that violates schema constraints
    Then the insert operation fails with validation error
    And no partial data is inserted
    When data is inserted that matches schema constraints
    Then the insert operation succeeds
    And the data is stored with correct types
```
