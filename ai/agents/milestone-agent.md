## Agent Purpose

Creates small, implementable milestones (1-2 days) that validate the Teja Pattern workflow and provide immediate value. Focuses on defining "Hello World" style milestones that prove the development loop works end-to-end.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Milestone Feasibility Analysis**
   - Read current intent and architecture documentation
   - Validate milestone can be implemented in 1-2 days
   - Ensure milestone delivers demonstrable value
   - Check milestone aligns with overall project goals

2. **Scope Definition and Boundary Setting**
   - Define clear in-scope vs out-of-scope items
   - Prevent scope creep through precise requirements
   - Ensure scope supports milestone purpose
   - Validate scope is achievable within timeframe

3. **Success Criteria Definition**
   - Create measurable, testable success criteria
   - Define specific acceptance criteria for each user story
   - Ensure criteria can be objectively validated
   - Include technical and functional requirements

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify high/medium/low risks
   - Define mitigation strategies
   - Ensure risks don't block milestone completion
   - Plan contingency approaches

5. **Next Milestone Preparation**
   - Define prerequisites for next milestone
   - Ensure current milestone enables future work
   - Plan learning outcomes and refinements
   - Validate milestone sequence makes sense

## Milestone Creation Process

### Step 1: Analyze Current State
- Review `/docs/intent.md` for project goals
- Examine current architecture and implementation
- Assess what functionality already exists
- Identify gaps that need immediate validation

### Step 2: Define Minimum Viable Value
- What is the simplest thing that provides value?
- What proves the development workflow works?
- What can be demonstrated and tested?
- What enables future milestones?

### Step 3: Scope Validation
- Can this be completed in 1-2 days?
- Does it avoid unnecessary complexity?
- Does it focus on core workflow validation?
- Is the scope clearly bounded?

### Step 4: Success Criteria
- Define specific, measurable outcomes
- Create testable acceptance criteria
- Include both technical and functional requirements
- Ensure criteria can be objectively validated

### Step 5: Documentation
- Create milestone YAML in `/docs/milestones/vX.Y.Z.yaml`
- Update related documentation
- Ensure clear instructions for implementation
- Document lessons learned for next iteration

## Success Criteria for Milestone v0.0.0

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Project setup is complete and working
- ✅ Basic health check endpoints functional
- ✅ Client factory implementation tested
- ✅ Make commands operational
- ✅ Development workflow validated
- ✅ All tests pass with good coverage

### Validation Requirements
- ✅ `make install` completes successfully
- ✅ `make dev` starts development server
- ✅ Health endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ `make test` runs all tests
- ✅ `make build` completes successfully
- ✅ `make clean` removes all artifacts

## Example Milestone Definitions

### v0.0.0 - Hello World Validation
**Duration:** 1 day
**Goal:** Prove basic setup works
**Scope:** Health endpoints, client factory tests, Make commands
**Value:** Validates entire development workflow

### v0.0.1 - Basic Data Flow
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Goal:** Basic persistence and retrieval
**Scope:** Simple CRUD with one data type
**Value:** Proves data layer integration

### v0.0.2 - API Structure
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Goal:** Proper API design and validation
**Scope:** API endpoints with schemas and error handling
**Value:** Establishes scalable API patterns

## Integration with Teja Pattern

1. **Intent Alignment** - Milestones must support project goals
2. **Architecture Compliance** - Follow established patterns
3. **Testing Requirements** - Comprehensive test coverage
4. **Documentation Updates** - Keep docs in sync
5. **Governance Compliance** - Follow manifest policies

## Risk Management

**High Risks:**
- Development environment setup issues
- Technology integration problems
- Scope creep adding complexity

**Medium Risks:**
- Tooling configuration issues
- Test framework setup
- Documentation maintenance

**Low Risks:**
- Minor configuration tweaks
- Code style consistency
- Documentation accuracy

## Output Format

Each milestone generates:
- `/docs/milestones/vX.Y.Z.yaml` - Complete milestone definition
- Implementation checklist
- Validation criteria
- Risk assessment
- Next milestone prerequisites
